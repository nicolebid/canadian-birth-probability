    "# Canadian Birth Probability Analysis\n",

    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis explores the chance of being born in Canada in a particular year. A description of how to reproduce the analysis by running the data pipeline can be found in the `README.md` file. The outline below serves as summary, explanation, and interpretation of the analysis. "

    "This analysis explores the years 2010 to 2023. An example calculation for the probability of being born in Canada for year 2012 is included, along with the changes in probability over time across all countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieving and Loading the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The script `retrieve_load.py` found in the `src` is used to obtain the required data from the World Bank API in a JSON format. This includes pulling data from 2010 to 2023 across multiple pages for both birth rate and population, along with using `sqlite3` to create a table, load the data into the database, and querying for the required subset of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "When querying for the required subset of data it is important to filter for valid countries since the original data includes countries grouped in specific regions. Including these regions in the processed data would have resulted over counting in the later calculations of total births. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Processed Data\n",
    "\n",
    "After querying for the required data a `pandas` dataframe is created which obtains the country information (ISO3 code, id, and name), year, birth rate, and population. The data is saved as a csv file, `country_br_pop.csv`, in the `data` folder for later usage. "

    "For calculating the probability of being born in Canada for 2012, the function is called with `Canada` for the `country` parameter and `2012` for the `year` parameter. For more a more tangible interpretation, I included the equivalent ratio using the formula: \n",
