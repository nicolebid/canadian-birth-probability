# The Probability of Being Born in Canada

By Nicole Bidwell

## About

This analysis explores the likelihood of being born in Canada in a particular year and delves deeper to discover trends in birth probabilities over time. The summary, explanation, and interpretation of the analysis can be viewed in the report linked below. The report also describes the scripts used in the analysis. Further comments are included within each script for clarity.

The analysis is implemented in a data pipeline, with all the scripts in the `src` folder. Steps to reproduce the analysis by running the data pipeline locally are outlined below.
